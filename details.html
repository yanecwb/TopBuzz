        Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has told the BBC she takes US
        President Donald Trump's remarks on making Canada the 51st state of his
        country "very seriously". "This is not a joke anymore," Joly told
        Newsnight. "There's a reason why Canadians, when they go out on a hockey
        game, are booing the American national anthem... We're insulted. We're
        mad. We're angry." Her comments come after Trump imposed 25% tariffs on
        products entering the US from Canada on Tuesday. Canada's Prime Minister
        Justin Trudeau called that a "very dumb thing to do" and announced
        retaliatory tariffs. However, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said
        Trump would "probably" announce a deal to reduce tariffs on Wednesday.
        In response, Joly told the BBC that "at the end of the day, the only one
        that really takes a decision is President Trump". She said no Trump
        administration secretaries had contacted their Canadian counterparts on
        Monday or Tuesday about tariffs.

      <div class="p-4 text-[14px] leading-[24px]">
        Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on 4 February, but
        delayed implementation until 4 March. Canadian energy imports face a 10%
        tariff. Ontario Premier Doug Ford implemented a 25% surcharge on
        electricity exports to three US states, and if tariffs escalated, said
        he would consider cutting Michigan, New York and Minnesota off from
        Canadian power. Trump also imposed a 10% tariff on goods worth more than
        $800 (£645) from China in February, which doubled in March. China
        responded with its own tariffs. The White House said when it introduced
        the tariffs that it was "taking bold action to hold [the three
        countries] accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration
        and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our
        country". Fentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in
        the US each year. Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than
        1% of fentanyl entering the US. Canada had introduced new border
        security measures in December, in response to Trump's tariff threats
        before he took office. "We didn't want this trade war. We did everything
        that was required under the executive order to make sure our border was
        safe and secure," Joly told the BBC, but said "this is a bogus excuse on
        the part of the Trump administration against us".
